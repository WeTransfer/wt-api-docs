# Introduction

Welcome to WeTransfer's public API! You can use our API to create transfers and boards to share files, links and love all over the world.

## Our APIs

To make sure you have as much flexibility as possible, we’ve released two APIs that both have their own usecases.

<div class="two-col">
  <div class="col">
    <span class="two-col__title">Transfer API</span>
    <p>Built to get files from one place to the other, this is the classic WeTransfer experience. Throw as many files at it as you can imagine, this thing will handle it with ease.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <span class="two-col__title">Board API</span>
    <p>Our new <em>Board API</em> was built based on the concept of our mobile app. It can handle both files and web content, and is flexible in how it displays it all.</p>
