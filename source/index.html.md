# Introduction

Welcome to WeTransfer's open APIs! You can use our API to create transfer links and share some files and love all over the world.

We have language bindings in Ruby and JavaScript for now. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
