# Welcome to WeTransfer's public API!

You can use our API to share files, links and love all over the world.

## Our APIs

Depending on what you want to make we have two different APIs: transfers and boards.

<div class="two-col">
  <div class="col">
    <span class="two-col__title">Transfer API</span>
    <p>Built to get files from one place to the other, this is the classic WeTransfer experience. Send up to 2GB of files per transfer and we will handle it with ease, with a built-in 7 day expiry. Once a transfer has been finalized, that's it - it can't be changed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <span class="two-col__title">Board API</span>
    <p>Our Board API is similar to what you'll experience with our mobile collecting apps. It can store traditional files as well as links, and is flexible in how it displays your items. Additionally - boards can be changed as long as they are live, so you can add items as you see fit.</p>
