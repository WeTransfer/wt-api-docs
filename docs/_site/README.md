## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

- **Linux or OS X** - Windows may work, but is unsupported.
- **Ruby** - version 2.3.1 or newer
- **Bundler**  - If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

## Getting Set Up

Initialize and start the docs:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4000. Whoa! That was fast!
